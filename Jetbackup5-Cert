ĐÚNG: 1. I can see backups in WHM for my client but when the client tries to browse his backups through the JetBackup section of the cPanel GUI, it appears as if there are no backups. How is this possible?

# Admin has disabled "Backup Visibility" inside the backup destination
Admin has prevented access to snapshots through JetBackup ACL
The backup index must be wrong(admin needs to run re-index)
JetBackup is not enabled inside cPanel’s feature manager

2. Which notification(s) below will you receive under a Critical Alert level?

JetBackup is unable to reach your destination
A backup Job partially completed
Custom hook failed to execute.
# An account restore failed to complete

3. How does JetBackup handle a multi-scheduled Backup Job?

JetBackup does not support multi-scheduled Backup Job and you would need to create separate Backup Jobs per schedule.
JetBackup executes backup jobs daily and retroactively modifies existing backups and tags with the correct schedule type that coincides with the schedules set in the backup job.
JetBackup executes the backup job for each schedule type to ensure that there’s a backup for the correct schedule regardless if it’s at the same time.
#JetBackup tags each backup with the appropriate schedule type(s) and only executes once if multiple schedules align at the same time

4. All backup destinations support incremental backups

Incremental backups are not supported at all
No, Amazon s3 doesn’t support incremental backups 
No
#Yes

ĐÚNG: 5. Can a client schedule a backup job to run right after another backup job?

It Depends on the job type, only same type backups can run one after another
No, each backup will run at the specified time in the job settings
# Yes - JetBackup has a schedule type "after job is done"
No, but backups can run simultaneously

6. What is an orphan backup?

A backup that was not indexed for more than 30 days, and removed from the DB. 
A backup of an addon domain that is not linked to any main cPanel account.
A backup from another control panel (non-cPanel)
# A backup of an account that has been terminated from WHM

7. What is JB config and when it's useful?

It’s a unique snapshot of your system’s architecture, used for licensing 
# JetBackup internal data containing all the configuration and is useful when migrating servers or restoring from a disaster
JetBackup internal database that is useful for logs and statistics
There is no such thing as JB Config

8. I have accounts with over 1 Million inodes, what is the best way to skip those accounts during a backup job?

Create a new filter type Accounts, choose the accounts you would like to exclude.
Create a new hook that checks account inode count and will fail the action accordingly 
Inside backup job settings, choose only the accounts you want to backup, skipping the affected accounts
# Create a new filter type "Inode usage" and set limits accordingly 
 

 9. Is there a way to log backup activity for a certain account?

No, it’s not possible
Yes, you can use cron jobs to monitor JetBackup jobs and identify when a certain account is backed up.
Yes, it is possible using cPanel settings in the Account
# Yes, through a JetBackup hook

10. Can I restore a single file from a backup?

#Yes, you can restore a single file from any backup
Yes, only from a Google drive destination
No, only a full account restore is possible
Yes, but this is limited to incremental backups only

11. Is it possible for a cPanel user to only view backups without being able to restore them?

Yes, but It depends on the backup job type (incremental vs compressed)
# Yes, using the JetBackup permissions system 
Yes, by default cPanel users can only view and root admin can restore
No, once a cPanel user has access to his backups he is not limited to any action

12. I have a Backup Job that has been running for some time. I then add a new destination for the same Backup Job. How will JetBackup process the backups on the first run after adding a new destination?

JetBackup does not allow adding a new destination once the destination(s) has already been set on the Backup Job.
# JetBackup will continue with incremental backups on the original destination and generate the initial full backups on the new destination.
JetBackup will remove the existing backups on the original destination and generate a new set of backups for both destinations to ensure consistency.
JetBackup will continue with incremental backups on both the original and new destination.

13. What are the benefits of a backup hook? What does it allow you to do in the general sense?

# A hook allows me to run a script at the hook point supplying relevant parameters
A hook allows me to rewrite & modify JetBackup core functions
A hook allows me to install 3rd party plugins
A hook is there for JetBackup internal purposes only 

14. Can you set the backup to run every 30 minutes?

No, JetBackup decides when the job will run randomly and the minimum interval is daily
# No, the minimum interval is hourly
Yes, only when the job is not running
Yes, there is no minimum interval

15.Compressed backups are supported for all destinations.

#Yes

JetBackup supports this through the interface, by checking "Backup Only Email Structure" under "Backup contains" from within a job's settings.

17. What is the difference between an archived backup and a compressed backup? (How is archived different?)

# Archived is an uncompressed version of a compressed backup
Archive is a gzip version of a compressed backup
Archive only stores changes inside tar file
There is no difference

18. What is required for a Backup-on-demand?

An active backup job with object storage support
# An active backup job configured for full account backups
An active backup job with incremental supported destinations
An active backup job

19. Is it possible to backup DNS Zones only?

Yes, inside backup job settings check only "DNS Zones" under "Backup Contains"
# No, a full account backup will contain all user data including DNS Zones.
Yes, using file excludes
